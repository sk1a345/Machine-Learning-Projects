# 🚗 Car Price Predictor

A web-based machine learning application that predicts the selling price of a used car based on user input such as company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project uses a **Linear Regression** model trained on cleaned car sales data. It provides a simple web interface (built with **Flask**) where users can select car details and get an estimated resale price instantly.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Dynamic dropdowns for car companies and models.
- AJAX-based prediction without page reload.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap 5.
- Preprocessed and cleaned car sales dataset.
- Trained ML pipeline with One-Hot Encoding + Linear Regression.

## 🧠 Model Training Summary

- Cleaned raw data:
  - Removed rows with "Ask For Price", invalid years, missing fuel types.
  - Converted strings like `"23,000 kms"` into integers.
  - Extracted first 3 words from car names for better generalization.
- Applied `OneHotEncoding` on categorical features: `name`, `company`, `fuel_type`.
- Used `LinearRegression` model from `sklearn`.

### ➕ Features Used for Training:

| Feature      | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `name`       | Car model name (first 3 words only)  |
| `company`    | Manufacturer                         |
| `year`       | Year of purchase                     |
| `kms_driven` | Kilometers the car has traveled      |
| `fuel_type`  | Petrol/Diesel/CNG etc.               |
